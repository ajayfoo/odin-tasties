    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup whole wheat flour</li>

        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>

        <li>3/4 cup hot water or as needed</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil or vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, and salt in a large bowl. Use a wooden spoon to stir in water and
            oil. Mix until a soft, elastic dough forms and add more water, if needed. Knead dough on a lightly floured
            surface until smooth.</li>

        <li>Divide dough into 10 equal portions, or less if you want larger chapatis. Roll each piece into a ball and
            let rest for a few minutes.</li>

        <li>Heat a lightly greased skillet over medium heat.</li>

        <li>Use a rolling pin to roll dough balls out on a lightly floured surface until very thin.</li>

        <li>When the skillet starts to smoke, place a chapati in it. Cook until bottom has brown spots, about 30
            seconds, then flip and cook 30 seconds more. Repeat to cook remaining chapatis.</li>
    </ol>
